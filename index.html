    <p><img src="./images/html.png" alt="HTML Logo" width="150px" align="top">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It structures content on the web using a system of tags or elements, like headings, paragraphs, links, and images, which browsers interpret and display. HTML is the foundation of any web page, defining its structure and layout, and works alongside other technologies like CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity). It's easy to learn and essential for anyone interested in web development.</p>

    <p><img src="./images/css.png" alt="CSS Logo" width="150px" align="middle">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to control the appearance and layout of a webpage. It allows you to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to HTML elements. CSS separates content from design, making it easier to maintain and update a website's look without altering the underlying structure. It plays a key role in creating visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly websites.</p>

It allows you to create things like interactive forms, animations, and real-time updates without needing to reload a page. JavaScript runs in the browser, making it essential for building modern, responsive web applications. It works alongside HTML and CSS to create a more engaging and functional user experience.</p>
